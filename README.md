# Mnemon

In order to demonstrate DDD principles the implementation of a Read-it-Later
service  has been chosen as a case study for my Master Thesis in 2014. The
implemented application is named Mnemon which a Greek word (μνήμων) and it means
someone that remembers everything. Although, Mnemon aims to capture web articles,
it could be possibly extended to memorise many more types of content like videos,
music etc.
